# Unity3D Syntax Highlighting 
#### for [Sublime Text 3](http://www.sublimetext.com/3)

## About
This is a Sublime Text 2/3 package adds language definitions for syntax highlighting of Unity3d C# and JavaScript 

## Usage
Once installed you can select view -> syntax -> Unity3D and then Unity C# or Unity JavaScript.
You may also want to select the "Open all with current extension" option so that Sublime Text 2 will always use 
Unity syntax highlighting when viewing C# or JavaScript Files.

## Install

### Package Control

The easiest way to install this is with [Package Control](http://wbond.net/sublime\_packages/package\_control).

 * If you just went and installed Package Control, you probably need to restart Sublime Text 2 before doing this next bit.
 * Bring up the Command Palette (Command+Shift+p on OS X, Control+Shift+p on Linux/Windows).
 * Select "Package Control: Install Package" (it'll take a few seconds)
 * Select Unity3D Syntax Highlighting when the list appears.

Package Control will automatically keep Git up to date with the latest version.

If you have some problems or improvements with it, contact me via GitHub.
